        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Garlfield's favourite meal, so it is mine too!</p>
        <ul>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles <em>uncooked</em></li>
            <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese <em>divided</em></li>
            <li>½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese <em>shredded and
                    divided</em></li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt <em>more to taste</em></li>
            <h4>Tomato Sauce</h4>
            <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>½ pound Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion <em>diced</em></li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic <em>minced</em></li>
            <li>36 ounces pasta sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <h4>Cheese Mixture</h4>
            <li>2 cups ricotta cheese <em>or cottage cheese</em></li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1 large egg <em>beaten</em></li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Bring a large pot of salted water to
                a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook until al dente (firm)
                according to package directions. Drain, rinse under cold water,
                and set aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown the beef,
                sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until no pink
                remains. Drain any fat.</li>
            <li>Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, ½
                teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer
                uncovered over medium heat for 5 minutes or until slightly
                thickened. Taste and season with additional salt if
                desired.</li>
            <li>In a separate medium bowl, combine 1 ½ cups mozzarella cheese, ¼
                cup parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, egg, and ¼ teaspoon
                salt.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9×13 pan or casserole dish.
                Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓ of the ricotta
                cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more.
                Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and sprinkle the top of the lasagna with the
                remaining 2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup parmesan cheese.
                Bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and
                bubbly. Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired.</li>
            <li>Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting.</li>
        </ol>
